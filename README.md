# JavaScript in the browser - Web APIs

This is a school project working with History API and local storage.
I created a single page application (SPA) plant collection. There are
three pages; front page, plant collection and favorites. On each plant
you can click on a more info button to show more info and click again
to hide it. Each plant has also a add to favorites button and when you
click it the plant shows on favorites page and the button changes color
and displays remove from favorites. You can click on the remove button
on either page to remove the plant from the favorite page. The plant
array is set to local storage so the plants stay as favorites when you
refresh.
